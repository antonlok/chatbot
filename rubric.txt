TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

People may begin to form unhealthy emotional attachments with chatbots that do not actually understand them. This can
ultimately result in a person preferring to talk to a chatbot rather than a human, which will lead to deteriorating 
relationships between them and other humans. It is concerning if they use this as a replacement for proper forms of 
human to human communication. Trying to use a chatbot in the place of therapists or other trained humans that can 
offer real help poses a grave danger to the user. We think it's important to have the chatbot mention that it is in
fact a piece of software every once in a while. This will help to keep the user from slipping into a state where they
believe the bot to be a human.
